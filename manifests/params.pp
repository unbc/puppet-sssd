# == Class: sssd::params
# Set up parameters that vary based on platform or distribution.
# 
# UID_MIN is the lowest uid allowed for use by non-system accounts.
# UID_MIN is often defined in /etc/login.defs
# As of RedHat Enterprise Linux 6, UID_MIN is still 500.
# But in Fedora >= 16, UID_MIN has been changed to 1000.
# https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/1000SystemAccounts
# I'm choosing to set 1000 as the default here, to be safe and
# forward-compatible.
